# CROWDFALL

A snakes and ladders game that uses web sockets to handle concurrent input from multiple users.

Users are randomly assigned to one of two teams that compete with each other to move their token to the top right of the board faster.

Built in 24 hours with Jim Kim ([regaldisclaimer](https://github.com/regaldisclaimer)) and Thomas Schaffner ([AFriendlyRobot](https://github.com/AFriendlyRobot))
